###Backbone Maps

A simple event bus for handling google maps events. Using the boilerplate code from the Google Maps api, this library serves as a simple way to bus events between Google Map objects and Backbone object. 

Boilerplate code is inevitable and the Google Map api takes the mystery out of writing it. This simply piggybacks off of Backbone.Events and leaves the map creation up to you. This allows for dependency injection so the library is better written, tested and more flexible to change (possibly other APIs) in the future.
